Collaborative Learning Platform

- **Introduction:** This application's purpose is to provide a digital space for students to share resources, work collaboratively, and mentor. 

- **Value/Use:** In a world where textbooks cost $200 buckaroos and school is heard, this app will provide a supportive community (hopefully) full of collaboration!!

- **User Interaction and Experience:** Users would be prompted to pick the school that they attend. From here, their will be dedicated subject areas (History, Math, etc.). Within each subject will be rooms for specific classes, here users can upload work, chat in discussion rooms, and collaborate (adhering to the honor code of course). Users who have previously taken the course can offer advice, share resourcers and tips, and give answers to tests (just yoking).

- **Competitive Element:** Their will be a voting system (kinda like stack overflow perchance). Poeple can get cool badges based on their total votes.

- **Engagement and Addictiveness Strategies:** The fact that this application will provide students with an easily accessible learning resourceful is valuable. It also offers oppurtnites for students to get ahead on coursework (without cheating).

- **Scalability and Expansion:** The fact that students can select their school means that this application is open to students across the worlds. I'm not hundred percent sure how schools would be added to the platofrm, either a student or faculty submitted request could be made.

- **Accessibility and Inclusivity:** Anyone can join!!! Yippee!!
